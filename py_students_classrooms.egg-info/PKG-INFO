Description: # py-students-classrooms
        Useful library made in python to handle students and classrooms
        
        student_clusters_in_classes(students, rooms)
        
        This function returns a list of students which are physically in any classroom with more than 2 students (using UTM projection to convert latitude and longitude coord to x and y expressed in meters)
        
        <p>Assumptions<p>
        
        - Each classroom has the a square or rectangular shape, every classroom has its dimensions.
        - None of the classrooms intersect.
        - Students are dimensionless outside of their latitude / longitude point
        - Height is not a concern for either the student nor the classroom
        - It does not matter which student was in which classroom, we only care about the list of students found
        - This is intended to be performed in memory where you donâ€™t have the usage of a database of some sort.
        - This function uses UTM projection which has a deformation using high latitudes
        
        Params:
        
        students: list of students
        classrooms list of classrooms
        
        Return: list of students inside a classroom with more than two students
